every neighborhood has a woman like alberta frome

and every woman like mrs frome has a cat

when she traveled , mrs frome would arrange for friends to look after her beloved pet

this time however , she was forced to ask her neighbor susan mayer,

Mrs. Frome liked Susan.

but it was common knowledge on wisteria lane    where susan mayer went bad luck was sure to follow

her misfortunes ranged from the commonplace to the unusual to the truly bizarre

As she waved goodbye , she worried susan's streak of bad luck would continue, for that matter , so did her cat

Mr whiskers Dinner time,

here kitty kitty

that's weird  cats can't open drawers can they

are you sure you didn't leave them open this morning

no way

do you think somebody broke in

though she didn't know it at the time ,susan's luck had finally started to change

news that an intruder had breached the security of wisteria lane spread like wildfire

at a neighborhood watching meeting the next night

residents voiced their concerns over the increasing dangers their community faced

mrs ida Grenberg announced someone was looking through her bathroom window whenever she took a shower

bob fisk warned those present that an unnamed government  agency was listening in on their phone conversations

helen vale spoke of a ruthless local teenage  gang that had egged her minivan

three factors contribute to

the evening concluded with officer thompson offering safety tips and a plan of action

the opportunity you have some control over

you can sign up for either daily or nightly patrols

I know that might seem like overkill

but I guarantee regular surveillance will deter even  the most determined criminal

so are there any other questions

all right let's be careful out there

I do have a question , do you have a second

sure , how can I help

I'm the one who discovered break-in

I think I found some evidence

I think this is a screwdriver left behind by the burglar

and I didn't touch it

why didn't you give this to the investigating officer

I tried and they sort of laughed at me


why weren't you sitting with mike tonight,
I thought you two were becoming an item
I thought so,  getting a lot of mix signals
I'll tell you who wasn't giving mix signals
sexy officer thompson
he was staring at you all night
you noticed that
honey trust me , when they're not staring at me , I notice

I really do appreciate you guys staying and helping

oh please I would have hosted it myself
kids are going to the mountains, but there's camping equipment everywhere
it's nice of you and since we're talking there's something else nice that I'd like you to do

your kids both went to Barcliff academy  didn't they
we need you to recommend porter and preston
we can't even get an interview


you want me to recommend the twins,
yes you can tell them , how beautifully behaved the boys are ,
so you want me to lie
yeah thought that was understood


I'm very well respected at Barcliff
and my word won't be good there any more


but by the time they realize their mistake, we're be in
you're not having any more kids, what do you care
I had hoped some day




they never used to fight like that when marry alice was alive
it's shame , they used to be such a happy family, just because you didn't hear them fighting doesn't mean they were happy






the next day , as residents began to patrol wisteria lane in the hopes of foiling potential burglars

Gabrielle was about to experience  a home invasion of her own

mama solis what are you doing here

I came to visit my son and daughter-in-law






hey screwdriver girl , I just came by to tell you that I took your evidence into lab fingerprint
really that' great, so I'll call you if I hear something
actually , I'd like to call  you anyway , if that's ok
you seem like a really sweet guy in an interesting line of work , but I'm not really available

hey mike ,
hey how's it going
just came by to say hello
so you remember the cop from the neighborhood watching meeting
he agreed to run a fingerprint check on the screwdriver I found at mrs frome's house
he did , nothing was taken
still, somebody broke in ,it's a crime ,so the weird thing is the cop asked me out on a date
I was just curious what you thought about that

so you're asking my permission to go out with him
no I just was wondering your opinion
I don't really have one

ok , great fine.thank you
susan wait wait,I'm sorry

my life is just really complicated right now,
you don't have to explain, it's complicated ,I got it




I was just about to grab dinner from the motel vending machine , and it occurred to me ,what the heck ,I'll go out ,
would you like to have dinner with me

mrs van de camp, guess what , I found all my mom's old christmas stuff

oh sweetie I was just coming over to talk to you , I am so sorry, but something really important came up and I have to cancel

we'll do it again, we'll have our






please answer,   pick up , oh thank god , Don't ask any question just get somebody down here to pick me up at
the corner nine and foster



Donation, Now Barcliff wants a donation ,
apparently we're in competition with one other family, a generous donation will ensure our kids beat them out
how generous ,
fifteen thousand,
we don't have that ,
and that's what I told them
so what do we do , public school is out unless we move to a new district
we're not moving ,
maybe it's time that we look into homeschooling,
I know you did not just say that,
honey it's got its advantages you know kids in home school do better in their later years
they won't make it to their later years if I have to spend all day with them
honey  sometimes you just you gotta make the sacrifice , it's probably the best thing for the kids
why don't we just put them back in me and cook them until they're civilized
