an odd thing happens when we die
taste,touche,smell and sound become a distant memory
but our sight, our sight expands
we can suddenly see the world we've left behind so clearly
most of what's visible to dead could also be seen by living
if they would only take the time to look
like my friend Gabrielle
I should have seen how unhappy she was . but I didn't
I only saw her clothes from paris
and her platinum jewelry. and her brand-new diamond watch
had I looked closer
I'd have seen Gabrielle was a drowning woman

desperately in search of a life raft
luckily for her  , she found one  , of course ,Gabrielle only saw her young gardener
as a way to infuse her life with a little excitement
but now she was about to discover, just how exciting her life could get


come on come on let's go

where are the rest of my clothes ,I'll find them ,just get out
where,
out the window

hi honey , you're home early
my meeting got canceled

you take a shower this morning
I just finished a workout






hey susan
mike
what's wrong
I didn't realize anybody was gonna be out here
I just sort of rolled out of bed
I'm sure you look fine

he scares easy

no it's fine I get it

I didn't mean to disturb you
I'll  see you later


do  you wanna have dinner with me


just the two of us

well and july

it's thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighborhood we invite them over for a home-cooked meal

sort of a tradition


said you were lousy cook

well I order takeout
oh you invite them over for home cooking and give them takeout
yeah it's sort of a new tradition

I'm working out the kinks


I'll tell you what
how about I cook

you and guys come over my place
great
friday night at 6
I'll be there

mike just invited us to dinner friday night

he did cool

but only I'm going because you're going to come down with something semi  serious that requires bed rest and fluids





sit in your seats
I'm not gonna tell you again
buckle up
I mean it so help me

licenses registration

mam you know why I pulled you over

I have a theory

kids are jumping up and down
they should be sitting , wearing their seat belts

I yell at them
they never listen to me, it's very frustrating
we gotta find a way to control them

though he'd been a policeman for six years

officer hayes had never found himself in a truly dangerous situation















I hope you don't mind
I thought I'd come by early and help you set up

don't worry mike and I've got everything under control

I don't know why he barks at you
I wouldn't take it personally.
Dogs are very sensitive
what's up
you never know  what freaks them out

in the distance susan thought she had a bell ring
is it a strange noise

what is it a weird smell

round one had started




who's the guy that lives across   mrs.huber again

that's mr. mullen

just do you know   if he invites you in you have to meet all of his pets
that's ok I love animals
thanks for the warning


isn't mr mullen'brother your divorce attorney

yes he was

can I say something

In my heart  I still believe  you and carl are gonna get back together

I've never seen two people more in love

I mean she's never going to find that kind of chemistry with another man
