an odd thing happens when we die
taste,touche,smell and sound become a distant memory
but our sight, our sight expands
we can suddenly see the world we've left behind so clearly
most of what's visible to dead could also be seen by living
if they would only take the time to look
like my friend Gabrielle
I should have seen how unhappy she was . but I didn't
I only saw her clothes from paris
and her platinum jewelry. and her brand-new diamond watch
had I looked closer
I'd have seen Gabrielle was a drowning woman

desperately in search of a life raft
luckily for her  , she found one  , of course ,Gabrielle only saw her young gardener
as a way to infuse her life with a little excitement
but now she was about to discover, just how exciting her life could get


come on come on let's go

where are the rest of my clothes ,I'll find them ,just get out
where,
out the window

hi honey , you're home early
my meeting got canceled

you take a shower this morning
I just finished a workout











I hope you don't mind
I thought I'd come by early and help you set up

don't worry mike and I've got everything under control

I don't know why he barks at you
I wouldn't take it personally.
Dogs are very sensitive
what's up
you never know  what freaks them out

in the distance susan thought she had a bell ring
is it a strange noise

what is it a weird smell

round one had started




who's the guy that lives across   mrs.huber again

that's mr. mullen

just do you know   if he invites you in you have to meet all of his pets
that's ok I love animals
thanks for the warning


isn't mr mullen'brother your divorce attorney

yes he was

can I say something

In my heart  I still believe  you and carl are gonna get back together

I've never seen two people more in love

I mean she's never going to find that kind of chemistry with another man
