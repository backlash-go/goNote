I hope you don't mind
I thought I'd come by early and help you set up

don't worry mike and I've got everything under control

I don't know why he barks at you
I wouldn't take it personally.
Dogs are very sensitive
what's up
you never know  what freaks them out

in the distance susan thought she had a bell ring
is it a strange noise

what is it a weird smell

round one had started




who's the guy that lives across   mrs.huber again

that's mr. mullen

just do you know   if he invites you in you have to meet all of his pets
that's ok I love animals
thanks for the warning


isn't mr mullen'brother your divorce attorney

yes he was

can I say something

In my heart  I still believe  you and carl are gonna get back together

I've never seen two people more in love

I mean she's never going to find that kind of chemistry with another man
